    <h4>PARAGRAPH</h4>
    <p>
        <b><i>All that glitters are not gold </i></b> is an aphorism stating that not everything that looks precious or true turns out to be so. The phrase is a translation of a Latin proverb, <i>Non omne quod nitet aurum est</i>, which appears in the 12th-century Latin poem <i>Speculum Stultorum</i> by the twelfth-century poet Walter Map. The original poem is a satire on the follies of monastic life. The phrase is often misquoted as "All that glisters is not gold", as in Shakespeare's <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> (Act II, Scene 7), written in 1596. The modern English version of the proverb first appeared in print in 1638 in James Howell's collection of proverbs, <i>Proverbs in English, Italian, French and Spanish</i>.
